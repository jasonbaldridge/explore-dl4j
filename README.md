Explore DL4J
====

Example code to explore for using [Deeplearning4J](http://deeplearning4j.org/) in Scala.

## Compilation and setup

You need Java 7 or higher and `sbt` installed.

Commands to checkout the repository, compile the code and add the bin directory to your path.
  
```
$ mkdir devel
$ cd devel
$ git clone https://github.com/jasonbaldridge/explore-dl4j.git
$ cd explore-dl4j/
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/devel/explore-dl4j/bin/
$ sbt stage
```

Feel free to use a different directory to put the code in and add the PATH to your bash profile, etc.

Note: if you change the code, you'll need to run `sbt stage` for those changes be available to the `bin` scripts. (Use `compile` in sbt while developing as usual to catch and fix errors.)

### Help

Use the `--help` option with any of the commands in `explore-dl4j/bin` to get all options available.

### Shuffling

Add this to your `.bash_profile` if you don't have the `shuf` command on your system. 

```
$ alias shuf="perl -MList::Util -e 'print List::Util::shuffle <>'"
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
This randomly reorders the lines in a text file. It is generally useful to have around for manipulating files. (I've found this method to be easier than installing actual a prebuilt 

## Instructions for sentiment classifier
  
Download the [sentiment140 data](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip). Make a directory, say `~/data/sentiment140`, and put it there. Unzip the file. This gives you two files: `testdata.manual.2009.06.14.csv` and `training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv`.

We need to shuffle the data because it is ordered by category and many machine learning algorithms don't behave well with such data. (E.g. online gradient descent.)

```
$ shuf < training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv > shuffled_training.processed.noemoticon.csv
```

We first need to train the word2vec vectors.

```
$ train-word-vectors --trainfile shuffled_training.processed.noemoticon.csv --vectorfile sentiment_word_vectors.txt --vectorlength 200
```

Run a sentiment classifier experiment. We'll run with less data to start with to ensure it is working. Create a file with just 10k examples and provide that as the input to `run-sentiment`.

```
$ head -10000 shuffled_training.processed.noemoticon.csv > small_training.processed.noemoticon.csv
$ run-sentiment --trainfile small_training.processed.noemoticon.csv --vectorfile sentiment_word_vectors.txt --evalfile testdata.manual.2009.06.14.csv 
```

This should run, though it'll get accuracy no better than chance. This is running a single layer network (logistic regression).

```
$ run-sentiment --trainfile shuffled_training.processed.noemoticon.csv --vectorfile sentiment_word_vectors.txt --evalfile testdata.manual.2009.06.14.csv
```
